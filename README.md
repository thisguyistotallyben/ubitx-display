My take on the Nextion display interface for the uBitx

# How to install
You need a micro sd card formatted for FAT32 through Windows. For some reason, using Linux based software like gparted does not seem to work.  Copy the corresponding tft file from the `compiled` folder to the card.  Then, insert the card into the screen's reader and turn it on.  When it is done, turn the display off and remove the card.
