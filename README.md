My take on the Nextion display interface for the uBitx

# How to install
You need a micro sd card formatted for FAT32 through Windows. For some reason, using Linux based software like gparted does not seem to work.  Copy the corresponding tft file from the `compiled` folder to the card.  Then, insert the card into the screen's reader and turn it on.  When it is done, turn the display off and remove the card.

# How to modify
Install the free [Nextion Editor](https://nextion.itead.cc/resources/download/nextion-editor/) which uses the .HMI file in the corresponding screen size folder.  The source images and fonts are also provided, but these are not necessary for running the editor as they are included in the .HMI file.
